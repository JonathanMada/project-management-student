This project was designed to practice all the skills I have gotten as a web-developer so far.

Description - The project is a web-app designed for teachers who want to create assignment or project for their students.
Function - Create and manage their project and assign them to students.
Future scope - The bigger picture of this web app is to allow any teacher to give his/her class at home. Moreover, this project remains scalable and can be used as a project management system

Technology stack:
  * HTML 5, CSS 3 (Plain no framework) - it gives me more control over the design of my app
  * Javascript (Jquery & Ajax) - I choose Ajax to use the request handling to the server, which allows us to have instant update on the front-end, without having any page refresh.
  * Python (Django) - Django is bulked up with various features that allow us to focus more on the business logic of the app and less database handling, thanks to ORM
  * SQL (sqlite3) - Very useful at development stage. 
  
Main features
  1. Enhanced user experience, thanks to its design and ease of use
  2. No page refresh and fully dynamic (thanks to XML Request)

Upcoming features 
  1. multi-users handling where we will have students profile and teachers profile. 
  2. instant messages. 
  3. video upload for teachers, where students can view each one of them.
